# Hi folks <img src="blobwave.gif" width="32"/>

I'm a software developer with a PhD 🧑🏻‍⚕️ in Computer Science from Niels Bohr Institute, Denmark. 🇩🇰

I love to tinker with various components and watch them work together in harmony. 👀

Using data to back up my claims is crucial; I want to know why I’m doing what I’m doing. 📈

I am competitive and want to be the best at what I do, which is why I'm always learning. 🤺
